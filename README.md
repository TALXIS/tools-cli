# TALXIS CLI (`txc`)

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in a development phase and not ready for production use.
> While we actively use these tools internally, our aim is to share and collaborate with the broader community to refine and enhance their capabilities.
> We are in the process of gradually open-sourcing the code, removing internal dependencies to make it universally applicable.
> At this stage, it serves as a source of inspiration and a basis for collaboration.
> We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions through pull requests.
>
> If you wish to use this project for your team, please contact us at hello@networg.com for a personalized onboarding experience and customization to meet your specific needs.

> [!TIP]
> **MCP Server Support:**  
> You can also use this CLI as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
> by installing the related .NET tool `txc-mcp`.  
> 
> This enables integration with tools and workflows that support the MCP standard.  
> For setup and usage instructions, see [`TALXIS.CLI.MCP`](src/TALXIS.CLI.MCP/README.md).

## Installation

```sh title="Install as a .NET global tool"
dotnet tool install --global TALXIS.CLI
```

```sh title="Update to the latest version"
dotnet tool update --global TALXIS.CLI
```

After installation, use the CLI via the `txc` command in any terminal.

## Example Usage

```sh title="Start the data transformation server on default port"
txc data transform server start
```

```sh title="Convert Excel to CMT XML"
txc data package convert --input export.xlsx --output data.xml
```

```sh title="List available workspace components"
txc workspace component list
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Component scaffolding in this CLI relies on the [TALXIS/tools-devkit-templates](https://github.com/TALXIS/tools-devkit-templates) repository, where all component types, metadata and definitions are maintained.

```sh title="Show details about a component template"
txc workspace component explain pp-entity
```

```sh title="List parameters required for a specific component template"
txc workspace component parameter list pp-entity
```

```sh title="Scaffold a new Dataverse entity component (important example)"
txc workspace component create pp-entity \
  --output "/Users/tomasprokop/Desktop/mcp-test/test" \
  --param Behavior=New \
  --param PublisherPrefix=tom \
  --param LogicalName=location \
  --param LogicalNamePlural=locations \
  --param DisplayName=Location \
  --param DisplayNamePlural=Locations \
  --param SolutionRootPath=Declarations
```

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed usage instructions, run `txc --help` or `txc <command> --help` in your terminal.

## Local Development & Debugging

1. Clone the repository and restore dependencies:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd tools-cli
   dotnet restore
   ```
2. Build the solution:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```
3. Run the CLI directly (for example, to test the data transform server):
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project src/TALXIS.CLI -- data transform server start
   ```
4. Debug using Visual Studio or VS Code as needed.

---

## Versioning & Release

- Versioning is managed in `Directory.Build.props` (Microsoft-style versioning).
- Releases are published to NuGet.org via GitHub Actions.
