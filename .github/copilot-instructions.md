# Copilot Instructions for TALXIS CLI (`txc`)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the TALXIS CLI, a .NET global tool (alias: `txc`). The CLI is designed to help developers automate tasks and execute other useful operations over their local code repositories.



## Instructions for Copilot
1. Do not remove comments or documentation.
2. Always use the `txc` alias when referring to the CLI tool.
3. When suggesting code, ensure it adheres to the .NET coding standards and practices.
4. Document hard to understand code sections with comments.
5. Do not duplicate code. Always separate concerns and use appropriate design patterns (SOLID/DRY).
